    <h2>Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      The Alumni Connect platform is designed to foster mentorship, networking,
      and career guidance between students and alumni in a professional
      environment. Students should approach alumni with respect, clearly state
      their requests, and be mindful of their time. They should use the platform
      for career-related inquiries, networking, and mentorship while maintaining
      professional communication. Alumni are encouraged to offer guidance, share
      industry insights, and provide networking opportunities while maintaining
      appropriate boundaries. Both students and alumni should avoid spamming,
      solicitation, or sharing personal information without consent.
      Communication should be clear, respectful, and timely. Participants are
      encouraged to engage in networking events, mentorship programs, and
      discussions while ensuring privacy and security. Any misuse of the
      platform, such as harassment or unprofessional behavior, should be
      reported for necessary action. By adhering to these guidelines, the Alumni
      Connect platform can serve as a valuable tool for career growth,
      professional networking, and meaningful alumni-student relationships.
